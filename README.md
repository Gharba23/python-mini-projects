# Python Projects

This repo contains beginner-friendly Python projects I built to demonstrate my understanding of core coding concepts and problem solving.

## Projects

- `text_analyzer.py`: Counts words, characters, and average word length from user input.
- `basic_calculator.py`: A simple calculator handling basic math operations.
- `fibonacci_generator.py`: Generates the first N Fibonacci numbers.

These examples reflect my interest in Python programming.
